# AI-Powered-Support-Ticket-Categorization

This project uses a local large language model (LLM) to analyze customer support tickets with **zero model fine-tuning**. It performs four tasks:
- Ticket categorization
- Tag generation
- Priority and ETA estimation
- Drafting professional support replies

The goal is to enable faster triage and response for support teams using a low-code AI solution.

## Dataset

- `support_tickets.csv` â€“ Contains customer-submitted support queries

---

## Technologies Used

- Python  
- [llama-cpp-python](https://github.com/abetlen/llama-cpp-python)  
- Hugging Face Hub  
- Pandas  
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## Project Highlights

- Loaded and queried Mistral-7B using `llama-cpp` on CPU  
- Prompted the model with structured tasks:  
  - Categorize issues (e.g., "Login Issue", "Payment Problem")  
  - Suggest relevant tags (max 3)  
  - Estimate priority & time to resolution  
  - Generate complete email replies  
- All responses parsed from JSON or plain text format
